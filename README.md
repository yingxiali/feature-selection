# Instructions for running the R code

This is the electronic appendix (R code)
to our paper, Benchmark study of feature selection strategies for multi-omics data.


The directory contains 3 main types of files, 

The first one is down_data, whose function is to download the data needed for this paper from OpenML using "datset_ids.RData".

The second one is AnalysisCluster, whose function is to  perform the benchmark study using the functions from the
Functions_AnalysisCluster files.

The third one is Functions_AnalysisCluster, which contains various feature selection processes and classification processes

# feature-selection

Functions_AnalysisCluster.R for rank methods, 

Functions_AnalysisCluster_1.R for Lasso, 

Functions_AnalysisCluster_2.R for Rfe, 

Functions_AnalysisCluster_3.R for GA
